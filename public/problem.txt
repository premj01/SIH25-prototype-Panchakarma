Problem statement
Background:- Panchakarma is gaining global recognition for detoxification, rejuvenation, and chronic disease management, contributing significantly to the projected USD 16 billion Ayurveda market by 2026. However, the lack of dedicated management software leads to: -Inefficient manual scheduling and documentation -Inconsistent therapy quality across centers -Limited digital patient management Advancements in healthcare IT and digital therapeutics present a timely opportunity to develop a software solution that integrates traditional authenticity with modern efficiency. Description:- The Panchakarma Management Software will feature automated therapy scheduling and provide notifications to patients regarding the necessary pre- and post-procedure precautions. The software will include: -Automated therapy scheduling system – to plan and manage therapy sessions automatically. -Notification system – to alert patients about pre-procedure and post-procedure precautions they need to follow. Innovative Features:- -Real-Time Therapy Tracking: Allow patients and practitioners to view therapy progress, upcoming sessions and personalized recovery milestones. -Visualization Tools: Use graphs and progress bars to track improvements based on patient responses and feedback. -Integrated Feedback Loop: Enable patients to report symptoms, side effects or improvements after each session, refining schedules or precautions as needed. Expected solution:- The software should address both core functionality and innovative enhancements to ensure usability, efficiency and patient-centric care. Platform should contain:- •The platform should have automated therapy scheduling Feature for both patients and practitioners to schedule, modify, and view upcoming therapy sessions. Pre- and Post-Procedure Notification System:- •Automated alerts and reminders to patients regarding the necessary precautions before and after procedures. •Customizable notification channels (in-app, SMS, email)

How large hospitals / academic Ayurvedic centres do Panchakarma
These are practices drawn from places like AIIA (New Delhi), Bharati Vidyapeeth’s Executive Panchakarma Centre, others. sushrutaayurvedahospital.com+3AIIMS+3coayurved.bharatividyapeeth.edu+3
Infrastructure & setup features:
•	They have separate theaters / treatment rooms (Panchakarma theatres) for OPD procedures and for IPD (in patient) therapies. AIIA, for example, has Panchakarma theatres on multiple floors, and each inpatient ward has easy access to theatres. AIIMS
•	Separate facilities or units for male / female patients. coayurved.bharatividyapeeth.edu+1
•	Different levels of hygiene, standards for food (“pathya” diet), rest and recovery, and pre /post treatment care. AIIMS+1
•	Day care vs residential/in patient programs: Some therapies can be done as day treatment; others require stay for several days/weeks. coayurved.bharatividyapeeth.edu+1
Treatment workflow / scheduling flow:
Here’s a typical order or sequence of steps in a Panchakarma program in a large hospital:
Stage	Activities / Requirements
Initial consultation & diagnosis	Assess patient’s prakriti (constitution), current dosha imbalance; examine medical history; laboratory or other supportive diagnostics if needed. Decide which therapies are needed; is patient fit for purification therapies (virechana/vamana etc). May include diet / lifestyle counselling. coayurved.bharatividyapeeth.edu+2AIIMS+2

Purvakarma (pre procedures / preparatory stage)	Snehana (oleation) – internal and external; Swedana (steam / fomentation); dietary modifications; rest; sometimes specific massage or fomentation to prepare tissues. These are done so that the body is ready for the main purification. coayurved.bharatividyapeeth.edu+2AIIMS+2

Pradhana Karma (main Panchakarma / purification treatments)	The five main cleansings: Vamana (therapeutic vomiting), Virechana (purgation), Basti (medicated enemas), Nasya (nasal administration), Raktamokshana (blood letting). The choice of some/all depends on disease, the patient’s strength, dosha imbalance etc. coayurved.bharatividyapeeth.edu+1

Paschat / Post treatment care	After care: diet / pathya, rest, gentle therapies to restore strength, follow ups, maybe milder therapies, massage, etc. Monitoring for side effects. Reintegration back into daily life. maharishiayurvedaindia.org+1

Variety of therapies used:
Apart from the core five, large centres offer a wide range of supporting therapies. Some examples:
•	Massage / external oleation (Abhyanga) with medicated oils. coayurved.bharatividyapeeth.edu+1
•	Swedana / fomentation. AIIMS+1
•	Specific local basti therapies (Kati Basti, Greeva Basti etc.). sushrutaayurvedahospital.com+1
•	Nasya, Shirodhara, Shastika Shali Pinda Sweda, leaf poultices, herbal steam etc. sushrutaayurvedahospital.com+1
•	Raktamokshana using leeches or other methods in some centres. blissayurvedaindia.com+1
Scheduling / operational challenges seen:
•	Patients need preparation time (pre treatment), cooling down / rest time post treatment. Some therapies are long in duration or require continuous time blocks (e.g. Virechana, Vamana) or continuous supervision.
•	Resource constraints: theatre rooms, beds, specialized therapists, oils, herbs need to be available; schedule needs to account for their availability.
•	Overlaps & dependencies: e.g. you cannot schedule certain therapies before the purvakarma phase is finished. Also for safety, there are contraindications (e.g. certain diseases, weakness, etc.), so the schedule must allow for doctor review / hold periods.
•	OPD vs IPD: Some patients are day visitors, some stay a week or more; different room types (private, shared), diet, lodging, nursing etc.
________________________________________
Some specific examples
•	AIIA (Delhi): Operates both OPD (with scheduled days/doctors for different specialities) and IPD. They have >100 varieties of “para Panchakarma” procedures beyond the core ones. AIIMS+1
•	Bharati Vidyapeeth's Executive Panchakarma Centre: Offers residential facilities, consultation, day care, diet management, lifestyle counselling etc. coayurved.bharatividyapeeth.edu
•	Sushruta Ayurveda Hospital (Karnataka): Provides wide range of therapies: Abhyanga, Patra pinda sweda, Shirodhara, Nasya, Basti, etc., with male/female Panchakarma theatres. sushrutaayurvedahospital.com

Key factors you should incorporate in your scheduling software
To make a robust scheduling solution for Panchakarma hospitals, these are important features / constraints to model:
1.	Multi stage treatment flows
o	Pre treatment, core/purification treatment, post treatment.
o	Some therapies depend on completion of others.
2.	Multiple therapy types with different durations and resources
o	Different therapies need different rooms / theatres / equipment / staff.
o	Some need special equipment (steam rooms, oil massage tables, Nasya chairs, etc.).
o	Some need continuous presence of specialist doctor / therapist.
3.	OPD vs IPD scheduling
o	IPD patients occupy rooms for days/weeks. Scheduling of bed, meals, nursing etc.
o	OPD/day care where patient comes in for one or more therapies and leaves.
4.	Staff schedules
o	Ayurvedic doctors, therapists, assistants, nursing staff.
o	Their availability, shift timings, gender preferences (male/female therapists) if required.
5.	Room / theatre availability
o	Distinct rooms for different procedures; some may be shared; cleaning & turnover time between patients.
6.	Patient constraints
o	Health status / eligibility (some patients may not be fit for certain therapies).
o	Required rest, diet schedules (pathya), pre checks etc.
7.	Follow ups and monitoring
o	Post treatment evaluations, visits, possible complications.
8.	Support services
o	Pharmacy, lab, diet kitchen, lodging.
o	Scheduling of meals, room services, etc.
9.	Record keeping and compliance
o	Keeping track of patient history, dosha diagnosis, treatment formulas, pathya/diet orders.
10.	Custom / package plans
o	Some hospitals offer packages (e.g. 7 day detox, 14 day purification, etc.).
o	Need the ability to bundle multiple therapies + stay + meals + diet + yoga etc.
